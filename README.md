REminiscence README
Release version: 0.5.5
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


About:
------

REminiscence is a re-implementation of the engine used in the game Flashback
made by Delphine Software and released in 1992. More informations about the
game can be found at [1], [2] and [3].


Data Files:
-----------

You will need the original files of the Macintosh release.

For the Macintosh release, the resource fork must be dumped as a file named
'FLASHBACK.BIN' (MacBinary) or 'FLASHBACK.RSRC' (AppleDouble).

For speech with in-game dialogues, you need to copy the 'VOICE.VCE' file
from the SegaCD version.

Running:
--------

By default, the engine loads the game data files from the 'DATA' directory,
as the original game executable did. The savestates are saved in the current
directory.

In-game keys:

    Arrow Keys        move Conrad
	A				  draw gun
    B		          use the current inventory object
    C	              talk / use / run / shoot
    Z		          display options
    Start			  display inventory / skip cutscene
